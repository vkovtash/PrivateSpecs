Part of any good iOS application's user experience is fast, smooth scrolling, and Fast Image Cache helps make this easier.\n\nA significant burden on performance for graphics-rich applications like Path is image loading. The traditional method of loading individual images from disk is just too slow, especially while scrolling. Fast Image Cache was created specifically to solve this problem.\n"
